## About my research

My research interests are focused on using plant physiology applied to crops, relating plant structure and function
to understand how we can optimize water and nutrient use efficiency, with a special focus on vegetable crops of the
Salinas Valley and California’s Central Coast.

I work at the interface of fundamental plant stress physiology and applied agronomy to address real challenges in
vegetable production, including drought, salinity, heat, and disease. By integrating field experiments, controlled
environment studies, and quantitative analyses, my goal is to support more resilient and sustainable vegetable
cropping systems.
